Problem Statement:
Write a Python script to control iTunes and play a song using AppleScript.

Description:
iTunes is a media player application developed by Apple Inc. This problem requires you to write a Python script that uses AppleScript to control iTunes and play a song.

Test Cases:
1. The script should be able to run on a MacOS system.
2. The script should be able to find and connect to iTunes using AppleScript.
3. The script should be able to play a song using AppleScript.

Solution:

```python
import subprocess

def run_applescript(applescript):
    """
    Runs an Applescript in the current system.

    Args:
        applescript (str): The Applescript to be run.
    """
    process = Popen(
        ["osascript", "-e"],
        stdin=PIPE,
        stdout=PIPE,
        stderr=PIPE,
    )
    process.stdin.write(applescript.encode())
    process.stdin.close()
    output, error = process.communicate()
    if error:
        print(f"Error: {error.decode()}")

def play_itunes():
    """
    Plays a song in iTunes using AppleScript.
    """
    itunes_applescript = b'''
        tell application "iTunes"
        play
        end tell'''
    run_applescript(itunes_applescript)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    play_itunes()
```

This script uses the `subprocess` module to run AppleScript commands in the current system. The `play_itunes` function runs an AppleScript command to play a song in iTunes. The `run_applescript` function is a helper function that runs an AppleScript command passed as an argument.
